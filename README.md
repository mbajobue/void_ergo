The VOID Ergo M is a fork of the [VOID Ergo S](https://github.com/victorlucachi/void_ergo) by [victorlucachi](https://github.com/victorlucachi/void_ergo). Changes from the original project:

- The Pro Micro microcontrollers are placed outside the case next to the switches. This allows the keyboard to have a much thinner profile. 
- Magnetic cover for a cleaner look.
- Big 2u key in the thumb cluster.

The VOID Ergo M is a 3d printed, handwired, split keyboard with a layout similar to the Iris/Corne/Kyria, running QMK Firmware on Pro Micro controllers. Connection between the two halves of the keyboard is made with an aux cable via serial.

Additional information to build this keyboard and flash the QMK firmware on to it can be found on the README file of the original project.
